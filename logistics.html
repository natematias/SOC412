        <h1>SOC412: Course Logistics and Policies</h1>

        <h2>Conversations on Slack</h2>
        <p>Please post discussions about readings and questions about the course to our chatroom on slack, <a href="https://soc412-2019.slack.com/">soc412-2019.slack.com</a>. Please use your Princeton University email address when requesting to join the workspace.
        </p>

        <h2>Group Work and Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>This class includes group work and individual assignments. On group projects, you are encouraged to work together on the activities for the class, but you are only only able to put your name on projects to which you made an intellectual contribution. If you have any doubts about what is appropriate, ask me.</p>
        <p>Any suspected cases of plagiarsm will be handled through Princeton University's honor code procedure, as outlined in <a href="https://rrr.princeton.edu/students#comp23">Rights,  Rules, and Responsibilities</a>.</p>

	<h2>Grading</h2>

	<p>Princeton's official grading policy is described in the <a href="https://odoc.princeton.edu/faculty-staff/grading-princeton">undergraduate announcement</a>. I use the following grading scale, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/scale.shtml">derived from Matt Salganik's grading practices</a>.</p>
	<p>Per university procedures, I will only give a grade of A+ in exceptional circumstances.</p<>

	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<td>Letter Grade</td> <td>Numeric Grade</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>A</td> <td>93 - 100</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>A-</td> <td>90 - 92.99</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>B+</td> <td>87 - 89.99</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>B</td> <td>83 - 86.99</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>B-</td> <td>80 - 82.99</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>C+</td> <td>77 - 79.99</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>C</td> <td>73 - 76.99</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>C-</td> <td>70 - 72.99</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>D</td> <td>60 - 66.99</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>F</td> <td>0 - 59.99</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
  
	<h2>Regrade Policy</h2>
  If you believe there was a mistake with a grade you received for an assignment, you must submit, in writing (email), a detailed and clearly stated argument for what you believe is incorrect and why. You should also attach a copy of the entire graded assignment. This must be submitted to Nathan Matias no later than the beginning of class one week after the assignment was returned. For example, if the assignment were returned on a Tuesday, your re-grade request would have to be submitted before the next Tuesday. Requests for a re-grade after this time will not be accepted.</p>

  <p>If you request a re-grade within the appropriate timeframe, a written response will be provided within one week of your request. This re-grade and written response is final. Please note that a request for a re-grade of a specific problem may result in a re-grade of the entire assignment. Therefore, a re-grade request may result in an increase or decrease of your overall score for the assignment. This policy is modeled after the policy of Matt Ratkovic, Matt Salganik, and Rocco Servidio.</p>
