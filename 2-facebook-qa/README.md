**SOC 412: Designing Field Experiments at Scale**

In this experiment, we randomly assign posts to receive an appeal for discussion or not and measure the effects, if any, on the number of interactions that those posts receive.

## Background
In this class assigment, carried out in teams of two or three, you will be expected to carry out a randomized trial over a 1-2 week period, combine data from your findings, analyze the results, and report what you found. The basic structure of this experiment is based on the [Facebook Poem Experiment](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/blob/master/1-facebook-poem/README.md) from last week. The purpose of this assignment is to give you a first opportunity to conduct an experiment live on the web.

You will carry out the experiment on your own. Since groups will analyze the results, you don't need a team yet.

## Purposes of the assignment
This assignment will support you to:

* Complete a full field experiment from start to finish in three weeks
* Think about the ethics of experimentation with the people in your life, as a precursor to doing experiments in other people's lives
* Debrief people about the experiment process
* Communicate experiment results to a public audience
* Collect data that we will be able to use to analyze multiple field experiments together

## Study Procedure
To conduct this study, you will need to carry out the following procedure:

* Each person should make a list of 22 things you would like to post (links, personal stories, clothing, music albums, films, poems, which thing people prefer out of two). The post should be something that you think people would be likely to talk about respectfully if you asked them.
* Use Facebook's [Custom Privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/help/459934584025324) to **exclude anyone who you know who is younger than 18 years old**. Whenever you make a post in this experiment, please use the "Friends Except" feature and select this exclusion list (read more about [Facebook's restricted lists](https://www.facebook.com/help/200538509990389?helpref=faq_content)).
* This procedure should also work on Instagram, Twitter, and Messenger.

* Each person **publishes a post once a day**, roughly at the same time every day:
  * Randomly assign that post to have an appeal for comments, or have no appeal for comment
  * Do not reply to comments on your post over the next 24 hours (you can do so after)
  * If you see a classmate's experiment post, **do not react or comment** on it.
* Every time you post, you should also:
  * Make a record in the spreadsheet about the previous's day's message at the same time you make a new post, roughly 24 hours later

Data about the study can be stored in an Excel spreadsheet like the one in this folder (Facebook RCT Example Spreadsheet SOC 412.xlsx), or it can be stored using a copy of [this Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yhgNmsFslc4nfIy-PTzFPgEDSOtrtuKH5wdzO-H0L0U/edit?usp=sharing).
