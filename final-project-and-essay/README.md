# SOC412 Final
This class has a three-part final:
* A *group presentation* of team projects in class son *May 9th*
* A *group submission* of project materials, due on *May 14th* at 5:00pm
* A *final personal essay*, submitted individually, due on *May 14th* at 5:00pm

## Final Presentation
This *8 minute presentation* should summarize your research design and the progress you made on it in the class. You should imagine that the slide is being presented to non-experts who are generally interested. 2-3 minutes after your presentation will be reserved for questions. Talks should include

* An introductory slide to set the stage
* A description of the context and partners
* A description of your research question from a pragmatic point of view
* A description of your research question from a scientific point of view
* Describe the experiment/project itself
* Report the current status and future of the project
* Each student takes 30-40 seconds to describe the wider issue you wrote about in your essay

## Final Project
We will agree on a case by case basis what each team's submissions should be. At minimum, all projects will include:
* An experiment plan (even if hypothetical), which references the power analysis that your team conducted
* A statement of what each person contributed to the project overall

## Final Personal Essay
In addition to your final project and presentation, the final includes a personal 1200 - 1500 word essay that unpacks or makes an argument about one of the topics we have explored in class, in relation to the experiment that you developed with your team. This essay should be your own work. The essay should also include a list of references.

This is an extension or further development of the idea you first developed in your [midterm](../midterm-project-proposal/), and the topic should be approved by the instructor. 

## Key Dates:
* Rough Draft: Due *May 3* at 5:00pm
